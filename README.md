## Hey! I'm Joel Carrasco 😁

  Currently, I am studying software development in the last year of my degree and working at a local company called RednBlue as a junior front-end software developer.

### By now!!💥
  I am working with frameworks like react.js, next.js and react native. I work and at the same time I learn in courses about these frameworks, in addition to the fact    that in each challenge I learn new things.
  
  My repositories are not up to date because I've been a bit busy, but soon I will bring new projects with JavaScript frameworks.
