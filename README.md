## Hey! I'm Joel Carrasco 😁

  Currently, I am studying software development in the last year of my degree. I am focusing on web development, especially on the front-end. Although I have dealt with languages like Java, Python, PHP, SQL, C#, I am learning HTML/CSS and soon JavaScript.

  I live in Panama, my first language is Spanish and then intermediate English, I am open to learning new methodologies, technologies and languages in the process.

### By now!!💥
  I am working on Frontend Mentor projects and changing things for fun, over time I will be uploading my projects and changes that they need.
