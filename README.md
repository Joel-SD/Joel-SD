## Hey! I'm Joel Carrasco 😁

  Currently, I am studying software development in the last year of my degree and working at Banco General as a junior software developer.


### By now!!💥
  I am working with frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular and React Native. I work and at the same time I learn in courses about these frameworks, in addition to the fact that in each challenge I learn new things.
  
  My repositories are not up to date because I've been a bit busy, but soon I will bring new projects with JavaScript frameworks.
